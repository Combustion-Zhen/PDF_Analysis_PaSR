\section{Introduction}

This work targets at extracting mixing time-scales in partially premixed combustion DNS results. The temporally evolving plane jet flames with syngas as fuel and air as oxidizer are tested with different value of the rich side equivalence ratio $\varphi_r$.

\section{Case settings}

Periodic at stream-wise and span-wise directions, outflow at the transverse direction.

1 atm, 500 K

Fuel stream:

Syngas CO H2 N2

Oxidizer stream:

Air O2 N2
